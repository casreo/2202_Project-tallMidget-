2202 team project 

This is a python program that uses the Volatility Framework to automate the process of analysing a memory dump. The program will ask for the path of the memory dump file and is able to find the suitable profiles for the memory dump for you to choose. You will then be presented with the options below: 

1. Check for suspicious processes
2. Check for hidden processes
3. Check for suspicious network activity
4. Check for common registry keys in memory for malware
5. Run any plugins in Volatility

Dependencies
Volatility must be installed and just copy paste the files into the volatility-master directory

Tested with Volatility Framework 2.6
